# heart_disease_prediction
In this project we can predict if a person can have a heart attack in future or not using machine learning models

Summary of the process:

--->Data Collection: Gathered data from various sources including Framingham, Heart Disease, and Cleveland datasets.

--->Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values using mean replacement, removed outliers using boxplot analysis, and balanced the dataset using SMOTE to address class imbalance.

--->Feature Selection: Utilized Feature Importance techniques to identify crucial features for cardiovascular disease prediction.

--->Model Validation: Tested the dataset using multiple machine learning models to assess their performance.

--->Testing Accuracy: Employed an ensemble approach by combining the best-performing models to enhance prediction accuracy.

This comprehensive process involved data preparation, feature selection, model testing, and ensemble techniques to achieve accurate predictions for cardiovascular disease diagnosis.
